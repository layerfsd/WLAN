Instructions for using the MAC Updater tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o Load the AR6K driver by inserting the card in the slot. 
o Go to Tools->Remote Registry Editor in the Platform Builder Menu
  and add the following registry entry.

  HKLM\Comm\PCCARD\ATHR-AR6K-<pnp-id>\Parms\defaultApp   0 // for CF cards
  HKLM\Comm\AR6K_SD1\Parms\defaultApp   0 // for SD cards
  defaultApp is a DWORD type registry key.

o Now unload & load the driver again by removing and inserting the card for the
registry entry to take effect.

o In case the AR6K chip is on board and cannot be removed & inserted from the
slot, we need to change the default value of this Registry key from 1 to 0 in
the source files & recompile the driver and load it.
  Open the file Regparse.cpp in the AR6K_DRV\host\os\wince\ndis dir and
search for defaultApp. In the CONFIG_PARAM paramTable[], change the default
value of the defaultApp registry key to 0.

o After loading the AR6K driver, from the Target-->Run Programs Menu, run the
MacUpdater.exe tool.

o Running the tool without any arguments will print the Usage.

o MacUpdater.exe takes 3 or 4 or 5 arguments.
  MacUpdater <AdapterName> <MacAddr> [eeprom | flash | eeprom flash]

  The first 3 arguments are necessary arguments. By default the tool updates
  the MAC addr in the eeprom only, if the last argument is not given.
  If you want to update ONLY in the flash, then you must specify the 4th 
  argument as 'flash'. If you want to update both in the eeprom and flash 
  then you need to specify the 4th & 5th arguments as ' eeprom flash'

o e.g
  For AR6K SD cards,
  MacUpdater.exe AR6K_SD1 00:03:7f:01:e0:27 flash

  For AR6K CF cards,
  MacUpdater.exe PCCARD\\<pnp-id-of-card> 00:03:7f:01:e0:27 flash eeprom

  The AdapterName of the cards can be got by running the ndisconfig tool in the
  platform builder Target-->Run Programs menu.
